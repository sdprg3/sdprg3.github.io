            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Hi. My name is Steven Pham. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I thrive on exploring different programming languages and enjoy collaborating with others to work on innovative projects that challenge and inspire me to do more.

              I have gained experience in C++, Python, and HTML/CSS from the projects and courses that I've done in UMKC, and I am still working to expand my proficiency and understanding in these languages, as well as exploring new options to expand my skillsets and knowledge,
              
              My personal interest includes gaming, travel, sports, and technology.</p>

            <h2>Education Background</h2>
            <p>I began taking college-level classes in 2019 as a Junior in high school at St. Pius X. I took courses that offered college credit in Comp Fundamental Apps and Calculus I, which gave me the opportunity to take subjects I had an interest in.

                Upon high school graduation, I decided to transfer to the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.
